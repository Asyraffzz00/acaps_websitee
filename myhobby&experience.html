            <div class="description">Hanging out with friends has always been more than just a casual pastime for me—it’s a way to create lasting memories and new experiences. One unforgettable moment was when I joined a friendly football match against Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM) at the synthetic field of UNITEN. The entire day was filled with excitement as my friends and I played together, testing our skills and working as a team. The experience wasn’t about winning, but about enjoying the game and supporting one another. This sense of camaraderie carried over when I participated in the Sports Day at UiTM Rembau, where students from various faculties came together to compete. It wasn’t just about the competition but about connecting with fellow students, laughing together, and sharing the highs and lows of the day. Both experiences showed me that hanging out is about more than just fun—it’s about growing closer with friends, pushing past limits, and creating shared moments that enrich our lives. These activities have helped me discover new aspects of myself, build stronger bonds, and embrace the value of teamwork and collaboration, all while having a great time with those who matter most.</div>
